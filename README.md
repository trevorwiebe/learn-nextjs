## This project was created to help me learn and understand Next.js at a deeper level. 
### Things I learned:
- How folder structure and file name are use in navigation, showing errors and loading, etc.
- The difference between static and dynamic routes, and when pages are cached.
- The difference between server components and client components and when to use each one.
- Wildcard routes.

## How to run this project on your machine
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
